# oop demo area

let's review oop by creating classes for three different actors of a little
game and playing around with them in tinker:

<img src="./game.png" style="width:100%; image-rendering: pixelated;" alt="">

when adding new namespaces, don't forget to run this command to make them
available in your code:

```sh
composer dump-autoload
```
